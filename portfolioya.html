                  <h3>  Throne of Glass series by Sarah J Maas</h3>

                <p> Genre:Fantasy</p>

              <div id="c1" class="collapse">
                <p>Throne of Glass is a young adult high fantasy novel series by American author Sarah J. Maas, beginning with the novel of the same name, released in August 2012. 
                  The story follows the journey of Celaena Sardothien, a teenage assassin in a corrupt kingdom with a tyrannical ruler. 
                  <br><br>The throne of glass is a series of 7 books and one novella.In each book, Celaena discovers a bit more of herself, her past, and her role in all of the events unfolding.<br>
                  Readers will get to see Celaena transform before their very eyes, the assassin becoming something new altogether by the end of the series.
                  Along the way, she’ll fall in love with a boy or two and make some incredibly tough choices.
                  As the tale progresses, Celaena forms unexpected bonds and uncovers a conspiracy amidst her adventures. 
                  <br><br>This series is easily my all time favourite and is almost an epic
                  Sarah J Maas hasn't included a single scene just for the sake of drama. Every word has been measured, found necessary, and only then added.
                  Other than a really strong, but still human protagonist, she introduces us so many more characters whom we shed tears with, rejoice with, get angry with, feel protective about and love.
                  Most importantly perhaps, this series made me realise the enormity of the task of writing stories. 
                  So if you haven't read this series and you are a YA fan, I implore you to go and check this series out and I assure you that you'll love every thrilling second of the ride!!

            <h3>
              The Witchlands Series by Susan Dennard 
          </h3>
        </a>
          <p>Genre:Fantasy</p>
          <p>Best age to read : 15+ yrs</p>
        <div id="c2" class="collapse show">
          <p>The Witchlands is a three book (so far), New York Times best-selling fantasy series centred around Truthwitch Safiya and her partner in crime Iseult, a Threadwitch. 
            It's set amidst a crumbling truce between three nations and a slew of much more immediate vendettas, and it's uproariously good fun.
          <br>The Witchlands has magic woven into the very fabric of society so that it really feels like the world couldn't run without it. 
          Sure, some witches (a non-gendered term here) are more powerful than others, and there are a few surprises up a couple of voluminous sleeves, but it’s refreshing to see magic that is also put to work.

          <br>Magic falls into elemental buckets that author Susan Dennard claims was inspired by the Avatar: The Last Airbender series; Aether, Void (generally believed to be only a legend), Wind, Fire, Earth and Water. Only in the rarest cases can a witch claim total mastery of their element, but usually they specialise in a certain part of it.
          <br>Ships for example will have the usual contingent of sailors, but they might also have a Tidewitch to help navigate, and Voicewitches (drawing on Aether magic), commonly found in towns, act as long-range messengers for hire. These limits lead to an interplay of witches and magic that makes for some fascinating relationships and power dynamics.
          <br><br>What made this book stand out for me was Susan Dennard's vivid descriptions of places and emotional relationships between the characters was what first drew me to the book.

              <h3>Court of Thorns and Roses series by Sarah J Maas </h3>

        <div id="c3" class="collapse">
          <p>Once you start Sarah J. Maas’s epic A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy, you won’t be able to stop. 
            It’s a fast-paced, addicting, romance fantasy series set in the world of Prythian. 
            The beginning of the trilogy is a Beauty and The Beast retelling with fae, demons, and otherworldly creatures, but it evolves into a series that is so much more than that.
            <br><br>
            Feyre is a 19–year–old human literally fighting for survival in the cold, harsh lands which are her home, but when she kills a wolf, her life is changed forever. 
            As it turns out, Feyre hasn’t only killed a wolf, but a Faerie, and she must now pay the price by leaving her family to enter the Fae lands and live there forever with her captor, Tamlin. 
            Now, you might think that the book would continue with the Disney tale, but it becomes so much more, packed with adventure and life. 
            It becomes an intensely gripping novel, not only about love, but also survival.
            <br><br>
            The best part of the series is how the characters, every single one of them evolve through the series. 
            Even though each book (to me) seemed to have such strong individual plots, Sarah J Maas helps us through these transitions seamlessly.
            And before you know it, you are standing on the precipice of the final battle, hanging on to your dear life and hoping that al the characters will make through it along with you.

            The Shiva Trilogy interprets the life of Lord Shiva as a common man.
            The Meluhans are search of a person who will become their messiah and save them from the Chandravanshis, their arch enemies
            Shiva grew up a simple tribal man from the Himalayas.
            But when consuming the somras his throat turns blue, he finds all of a sudden, the people of the Meluhan empire turn to him, the people proclaimed "The Legendary Neelkanth", to save their kingdom. 
            In the battle to find the true evil plaguing the Suryavanshis, Shiva soon learns that what is seen is rarely the truth, and he has to overcome tragedy, deceit and personal loss as friends turn foes and he finds the real enemy, hidden deep inside. 
            <br><br>
            The Shiva trilogy is an immensely popular retelling of the story of the Indian God Shiva.
            One of the best elements of this book is the characters and their historical background.
            They are inspiring and loyal to the very end which does however turn this book a little black and white.
            And even though the story is engaging, the style of writing is quite literal which turned out to be a big disappointment.

              <p>
                Legend is a 2011 dystopian young adult novel written by American author Marie Lu. 
                It is the first book in the Legend series followed by Prodigy, Champion, and Rebel.
                What was once the western United States is now home to the Republic, a nation perpetually at war with its neighbors. <br><br>
                Born into an elite family in one of the Republic’s wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic’s highest military circles. 
                Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country’s most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem.
                <br><br>From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths—until the day June’s brother, Metias, is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. 
                Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family’s survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias’s death.
                 But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths their country will go to keep its secrets.
                 <br><br>
                 The series starts off a little slow but then picks up with the action and a good number of plot twists. 
                 The only thing that I can complain about this book would be the concept of inst-love, but since the book doesn't really focus much on the romance, I'd say that this cn easily be overlooked.

            Oppressed for generations, The Scholars live with earning next to nothing, living in fear of raids, of imprisonment, or simply disappearing in the dead of the night to never be heard of again, not even by the people who love you them the most. 
            The once great Scholar empire is trembling at the hands of the Marshals that conquered them.
            Even though The Resistance has been working for years, it has never succeeded. 
            They are just rumours at every child hears of - ones where they break people out of prison, ones where they can make people leave this land and escape to the free land. 
            But association with them is punishable by death, after such horrendous torture that you’re practically begging for it.
            The Masks are the Marshal’s strongest weapon. 
            Trained from an early age to be the most cold-hearted, dangerous assassins to help keep Law and Order in the Empire, they are what haunts the Scholars – they are killers without remorse. Elias Veturius is one of these Masks, about to graduate and inflict a world of pain onto the Scholars.
            <br><br>
            Laia is a Scholar, who was apprenticing to become a healer, until a Mask in a nighttime raid took her only brother away, for possible association with the Resistance. 
            Left with nothing, Laia has but one choice – find the Resistance, even if it means death.<br>
            <br>
            Ember in the Ashes does initially appear to not have much to offer. But Tahir wins us over with her very real depiction of oppression. 
            Everything she writes feels very authentic- the gray areas in war, the pull of family ties, the desperation and fear of a girl having everything to lose.

            The poverty stricken Reds are commoners, living under the rule of the Silvers, elite warriors with god-like powers.<br>
            To Mare Barrow, a 17-year-old Red girl from The Stilts, it looks like nothing will ever change.
            Mare finds herself working in the Silver Palace, at the centre of those she hates the most. 
            She quickly discovers that, despite her red blood, she possesses a deadly power of her own. 
            One that threatens to destroy Silver control.<br><br>
            But power is a dangerous game. And in this world divided by blood, who will win?
            <br><br>
            The entire Red Queen world could be seen as combination of lots of other fantasy and dystopian worlds so some parts may feel a little bit cliched.
            What I enjoyed about Red Queen was the characters and their growth. <br>
            I'd say that the villain (Is he though?) is one of those characters that you hate but still feel bad for and sometimes even love. 
            There is quite a bit of political chess moves that keeps us guessing the next move and keeps the story engaging. 
            All in all, the series is an interesting read, that you should definitely check-out.

                <p>Tessamy’s life is a balance between acting like an upper class Patron and dreaming of the freedom of the Commoners. Jes’ father, born into the Patron class, insisted she and her three sisters adhere to strict Patron protocols. 
                  Their Commoner mother submitted gracefully but at the price of openly affirming her Efean heritage.
                  But at night she can be whomever she wants when she sneaks out to train for The Fives, an intricate, multi-level athletic competition that offers a chance for glory to the kingdom’s best competitors.

                  Then Jes meets Kalliarkos, and an unlikely friendship between a girl of mixed race and a Patron boy causes heads to turn.

                  When a scheming lord tears Jes’s family apart, she’ll have to test Kal’s loyalty and risk the vengeance of a powerful clan to save her mother and sisters from certain death.
                  During this grueling ordeal, Jes begins to realize the power Efean heritage holds and to sense that it’s somehow interwoven with the game of Fives. 
                  Far more than a game, its meaning remains unclear, its history lost or forgotten. 
                  <br><br>
                  This series opener, the auspicious teen debut of a seasoned author of adult fantasy and World Fantasy Award finalist, features a gripping, original plot and vivid, complicated characters.
                  Court of Fives is a novel with very wide appeal, which benefits from a young, headstrong, and charismatic protagonist, a mythically-inspired setting that provides a fantastical spin on historical/classical antiquity (think ancient Egypt, Macedonia, and Rome), a strong base of well-rounded supporting characters, and the magnetic force of its dramatic tension, which kept this reader glued to the pages.

          <p>The Remnant Chronicles is a young adult trilogy by Mary E. Pearson, that was published in 2014 (The Kiss of Deception, The Heart of Betrayal and The Beauty of Darkness.)
            <br>
            <br> The Remnant Chronicles, focuses on Lia, a princess who's determined to change her preordained fate. 
            Born into a highly traditional society, Lia decides to run away with Pauline, from home and an arranged marriage to a stranger prince.
            She hopes to build a new life- a life of an ordinary girl- in the peaceful village of Terravin.
            <br><br>
            She settles into a new life when two mysterious and handsome strangers arrive—and unaware that one is the jilted prince and the other an assassin sent to kill her. 
            Despite to peril of her current situation, Lia quickly finds herself increasingly attracted to the strange men – perhaps seeking a romance of her own choice, rather than an arranged marriage. 
            But Lia’s freedom brings many dangers – men hunt her, her parents have disavowed her, and she has no idea who she can trust. 
            <br>
            Deception abounds, and Lia finds herself on the brink of unlocking perilous secrets.
            <br><br>
            The best part about this book is the flow of the writing. 
            The descriptions, the character arcs and the clear acknowledgement of the fact that emotions are not always easy to pin-point
            The one thing I didn't really enjoy about this book was that the romance part was a little too forced and unrealistic.

            Meet Karou.<br>
            She fills her sketchbooks with monsters that may or may not be real, she’s prone to disappearing on mysterious "errands", she speaks many languages - not all of them human - and her bright blue hair actually grows out of her head that color.
            Around the world, black hand prints are appearing on doorways, scorched there by winged strangers who have crept through a slit in the sky.
            But what does this have to do with her? 
            Who is she? 
            That is the question that haunts her, and she’s about to find out as she pulled into a brutal otherworldly battle.
        
            <br>
            The best part about this series is Laini Taylor's world building- something she does with loving setails.
            Another pro point is that starting off you know exactly as much as the protagonist.
            So you get to travel the whole journey with Karou and learn everything as she does and Laini Taylor's effortlessly fluid descriptions make the series even more magnetic.
            One thing that you should know before you pick up this book is that it has tons and tons of otherworldly creatures (Something that I didn't enjoy so much.).
            So if otherworldy creatures and never-ending war isn't your cup of tea, then I wouldn't reccomend this book.
