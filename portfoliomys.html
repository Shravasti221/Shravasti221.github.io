<p id="info"> Sometimes you get in the mood for a little suspense, and there's no better way to scratch that itch than with a killer book—literally. 
  Thrillers and mysteries never fail to get your heart pumping, making you turn the page at warp speed while also delivering an oddly satisfying uneasiness about what's to come. 
  And considering that we are all being driven mad by boredom in this lockdown period, thrillers seem to be the entertainment of the season.... So go ahead and heck these books out! </p>

                <p >"Ten . . ."<br>
                  1939. Europe teeters on the brink of war.
                  Ten strangers are lured to an isolated island mansion off the Devon coast under mysterious circumstances at the request of Mr. and Mrs. Owen, but none of them have their hosts. 
                  Each person has their own reasons for coming to the island.<br>
                  "Nine . . ."<br>
                  At dinner a recorded message accuses each of them in turn of having a guilty secret, and by the end of the night one of the guests is dead.<br>
                  "Eight . . ."<br>
                  Stranded by a violent storm, and haunted by a nursery rhyme counting down one by one . . . as one by one . . . they begin to die.<br>
                  "Seven . . ."<br>
                  Which among them is the killer and will any of them survive?<br>
                  <br>This book starts hurdling into the mystery at a fast pace and never lets up. 
                  The plot is quick and intense, and I dare you to even try to figure out who the murderer is before the book tells you. 
                  I would give this book nine out of ten, if only for the fact that being published eighty years ago and British, some of the vocabulary is difficult to understand. However, it doesn’t take much away from the amazing plot by the queen of mystery herself. 
                  <br>
                  This book is for people who love mystery, for people that can’t stop watching true crime videos (it’s not real, but sure feels like it) and anyone that enjoys classic detective stories.

            After losing a libel case and finding himself in the tenuous position of being behind bars, magazine publisher Mikael Blomkvist is approached by a member of an illustrious and wealthy family to help solve a mystery that has been haunting them all for years. 
            Harriet Vanger, the attractive young niece of the man asking for assistance, disappeared from the family’s residence decades earlier under mysterious circumstances. Armed with photographs, a puzzling journal, and the somewhat reluctant aid of the remaining living family members, Mikael dives into the case. 
            He has been promised vital information that plays against his libel case and the plaintiff he considers his enemy, and Mikael is anxious to find answers.
            <br><br>
            As Blomkvist digs deeper into the past of the Vanger family, he is increasingly unsettled by the information he uncovers. 
            Spurred on by the vague entries found in Harriet’s journal, Mikael begins to believe that a serial killer may be involved and that the crimes far extend beyond simple murder. 
            The instinctual journalistic side of him takes control and he follows the clues farther and farther, into dark places full of sadistic intrigue and familial problems. Finding himself a tad in-over-his-head in the research department, Mikael hires an assistant, the complicated and emotionally vacant Lisbeth Salander.
            With a story of her own that is laced in abusive relationships and mentally taxing circumstances, Lisbeth is a creature who is deeply troubled with a personality that sometimes borders on offensive. 
            She’s dark and twisty, but the comforts she finds in the regularity of the tech world and her power over computer and program manipulations allows Lisbeth to hold on to some sacred parts of herself. 
            Having been used, discarded, and vilely mistreated by those entrusted with her care, Lisbeth is wary and skittish. 
            Nothing in the investigation into Harriet’s disappearance follows a logical path, and it is Lisbeth’s job to help Mikael connect the dots and put the case to rest.
            <br><br>This book is a part of the Millennium Series.

            While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. 
            Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. Solving the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of da Vinci…clues visible for all to see…and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.
            <br><br>
            Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and da Vinci, among others. 
            The Louvre curator has sacrificed his life to protect the Priory’s most sacred trust: the location of a vastly important religious relic, hidden for centuries.
            <br><br>
            In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who appears to work for Opus Dei—a clandestine, Vatican-sanctioned Catholic sect believed to have long plotted to seize the Priory’s secret. 
            Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory’s secret—and a stunning historical truth—will be lost forever.
            <br><br>
            In an exhilarating blend of relentless adventure, scholarly intrigue, and cutting wit, symbologist Robert Langdon (first introduced in Dan Brown’s bestselling Angels & Demons) is the most original character to appear in years. 
            The Da Vinci Code heralds the arrival of a new breed of lightning-paced, intelligent thriller…surprising at every twist, absorbing at every turn, and in the end, utterly unpredictable…right up to its astonishing conclusion.

              <p>Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier tells the story of a young, unnamed protagonist who meets a handsome, older gentleman, Maxim de Winter, in Monte Carlo. 
                It is well-known that Maxim's widely adored wife Rebecca, has recently drowned at sea and the local people of Maxim's home county are devastated. 
                She quickly falls in love with Maxim and the couple enter into a whirlwind marriage despite Maxim's troubled past. 
                On arriving home to Maxim's West Country estate 'Manderley' after their honeymoon, she faces a painful struggle against the 'other woman' Rebecca, whose presence at Manderley remains overbearing even from beyond the grave. 
                As the new lady of the house, Maxim's new wife is constantly compared to Rebecca, who was loved and admired by all, and struggles to adjust to Maxim's more privileged way of life and find her own identity amongst Rebecca's legacy. 
                However, as the story unfolds it becomes clear that Rebecca was not as angelic as people had believed her to be and her death is not as tragically accidental as it would seem...
              <br><br>
                Rebecca is an absolutely gripping and powerful novel to which any teenage girl can relate as the themes of identity crisis and competition with another woman will undoubtedly have resonance for many readers.
                Manderley is brilliantly depicted as the hellish gothic mansion to which the protagonist cannot adjust and it is almost a character in itself as it seems to breathe and tremble with Rebecca's haunting presence. 
                Mrs Danvers too is a delightfully menacing character, whose devilish antics and abnormal obsession with Rebecca intensifies the gloomy atmosphere. Rebecca has something for everyone: Romance, Horror, Crime and Mystery and its delicious turn of events will leave readers astonished.

            Even so, she rides the commuter train to London every day. 
            The train stops at a station that overlooks her old home, where her ex-husband Tom now lives with his wife, Anna, and the daughter he and Anna had together. 
            Rachel couldn’t have children, which she believes started the downward spiral in their marriage.

          Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night.

              The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie

        <div id="c7" class="collapse">
          <p>
            In this, Agatha Christie’s well-known Poirot novel, first published in 1926, the great detective has retired to King’s Abbot, the home of an old friend of his, the wealthy Roger Ackroyd. 
            Poirot is living anonymously, growing vegetables and enjoying the quiet life, when Ackroyd is murdered.
            <br>
            Despite keeping his past career secret since his move, the detective is outed by his next-door neighbour Flora Shepherd, who is living with her brother James, the village doctor. 
            James was at Ackroyd’s house the night of the murder, and over the course of the investigation he steps in as Poirot’s sidekick; Hastings is out of the picture, having married and settled in the Argentine.<br>
            The narrative is told from the doctor’s point of view as he documents the investigation, the sparks of genius from Poirot and his own bemusement at the seemingly random connections made by those famous ‘little grey cells’. 
            As Hastings did before him, he gives insight into the workings of the detective’s analytical mind, as well as throwing light on the nuances of the suspects. 
            While Poirot sees them simply as pieces of the puzzle, the doctor shines a light on them as people who are as flawed as they are good.
            <br>Between the murder and the big reveal, the plot contains Christie’s signature twists and turns. There are red herrings aplenty and many different interpretations of the facts presented, depending on who is doing the theorising. 
            But this book is famous for its unusual, and at the time innovative, ending – the introduction of an unreliable narrator. 
            It’s the kind of book you want to immediately go back and read again once the killer has been revealed, to see if the clues do in fact fit the revelation.

                  The Andromeda Strain is a 1969 techno-thriller novel by Michael Crichton, his first novel under his own name and his sixth novel overall.
                  <br><br>
                  A military space probe, sent to collect extraterrestrial organisms from the upper atmosphere, is knocked out of orbit and falls to Earth. Twelve miles from the crash site, an inexplicable and deadly phenomenon terrorizes the residents of a sleepy desert town in Arizona, leaving only two survivors: an elderly addict and a newborn infant.
                  <br><br>
                  The United States government is forced to mobilize Project Wildfire, a top-secret emergency response protocol as it tries to discover what ominous extraterrestrial entity is causing the plague... as it slowly mushrooms. 
                  <br><br>
                  Four of the nation’s most elite biophysicists are summoned to a clandestine underground laboratory located five stories beneath the desert and fitted with an automated atomic self-destruction mechanism for cases of irremediable contamination. 
                  Under conditions of total news blackout and the utmost urgency, the scientists race to understand and contain the crisis. 
                  But the Andromeda Strain proves different from anything they’ve ever seen—and what they don’t know could not only hurt them, but lead to unprecedented worldwide catastrophe.
                  Brought right down to earth by what has appeared recently in the news, an exciting demonstration of the possible impossible.
